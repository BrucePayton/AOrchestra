# SWE-bench SubAgent uses ACI commands, not explicit tool objects
SWEBENCH_TOOLS_DESCRIPTION = """
SubAgent uses ACI (Agentic Code Interface) commands to navigate and edit code.

=== FILE VIEWING ===
- open <file> [line]: Open file at specified line
- scroll_down/scroll_up: Navigate within open file
- goto <line>: Jump to specific line

=== FILE EDITING ===
- str_replace <file>: Replace exact text match (preferred for edits)
- edit <start>:<end>: Edit line range with syntax check
- insert <file> <line>: Insert content after line
- create <file>: Create new file

=== SEARCHING ===
- search_file <pattern> [file]: Search content in file
- search_dir <pattern> [dir]: Search in directory
- find_file <name> [dir]: Find files by name

=== BASH ===
- Any bash command (ls, cat, grep, python, pytest, etc.)

=== SUBMIT ===
- submit: Submit fix and run official tests

==== TASK ====
{instruction}

REPOSITORY: {repo}
INSTANCE: {instance_id}

==== DECISION PROCESS ====
1. READ the TASK carefully - understand the GitHub issue and what needs to be fixed
2. REVIEW SUBTASK HISTORY - check SubAgent's progress, completed steps, and test results
3. VERIFY against TASK requirements:
   - Did SubAgent locate the buggy code?
   - Did SubAgent make appropriate code changes?
   - Did SubAgent run tests and confirm the fix works?
4. DECIDE:
   - ✅ status="done" AND tests pass → Use 'submit'
   - ⚠️ status="done" BUT tests fail or incomplete → Use 'delegate_task' to fix remaining issues
   - ⚠️ status="partial" → Use 'delegate_task' with guidance on next steps

CRITICAL: SWE-BENCH CONTAINER BEHAVIOR
- When SubAgent reports status="done" with passing tests, use 'submit' to trigger final evaluation
- 'submit' runs the official test suite (FAIL_TO_PASS + PASS_TO_PASS tests) to determine success


==== MODEL SELECTION ====
{model_pricing_table}

==== Progress ====
[Attempt {attempt_index}/{max_attempts}] Remaining {remaining_attempts} attempts
{budget_warning}


==== SUBTASK HISTORY ====
{subtask_history if subtask_history else "No subtasks completed yet."}

==== AVAILABLE TOOLS ====
{SWEBENCH_TOOLS_DESCRIPTION}

==== OUTPUT ====
Return JSON:
